/*
 * This script plugin configures formatting for Java source using Spotless
 * for Gradle. Since the act of formatting existing source can interfere
 * with developers' workflows, we don't automatically format all code
 * (yet). Instead, we maintain a list of projects that are excluded from
 * formatting, until we reach a point where we can comfortably format them
 * in one go without too much disruption.
 *
 * Any new sub-projects must not be added to the exclusions list!
 *
 * To perform a reformat, run:
 *
 *     ./gradlew spotlessApply
 *
 * To check the current format, run:
 *
 *     ./gradlew spotlessJavaCheck
 *
 * This is also carried out by the `precommit` task.
 *
 * For more about Spotless, see:
 *
 * https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/master/plugin-gradle
